# C++ Projects

This repository contains a series of C++ projects designed to demonstrate and solidify key programming concepts. Each project covers one or more essential features of C++ and provides practical examples to aid in understanding and mastery.

## Topics Covered

1. **Classes**
   - Implementation of user-defined types using classes.
   - Understanding member variables, constructors, destructors, and member functions.
   - Emphasis on object-oriented principles like data hiding and code modularity.

2. **Inheritance**
   - Exploration of class hierarchies and how derived classes inherit from base classes.
   - Demonstrating access specifiers and their impact on inheritance.
   - Use of single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance.

3. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**
   - Creation and use of pure virtual functions.
   - Designing interfaces and understanding the role of abstract classes.
   - Illustrating how interfaces promote polymorphic behavior.

4. **Containers, Templates, Iterators, Algorithms**
   - Utilizing and customizing container templates to store and manage data collections.
   - Implementation and usage of iterators to traverse data structures.
   - Examples of algorithm use for efficient data processing and manipulation.
   - Insights into selecting the appropriate algorithms and iterators for various scenarios.

5. **Function Templates**
   - Introduction to template programming for writing generic and reusable code.
   - Demonstrating the flexibility of function templates in different scenarios.
   - Working with type parameters and their practical applications.

6. **Polymorphism**
   - Examples of both compile-time (function overloading and operator overloading) and runtime (virtual functions) polymorphism.
   - Understanding how polymorphism enhances code flexibility and extensibility.

7. **Encapsulation**
   - Implementation of encapsulation to safeguard object integrity.
   - Making use of access specifiers to control access to class members.
   - Illustrating data hiding and the importance of member functions for controlled data access.

8. **C++ Casts**
   - Understanding different types of casts: `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`.
   - Examples illustrating when and how to use each cast safely.
   - Discussing the implications and potential pitfalls of type conversions.

9. **Floating-Point Handling**
   - Working with floating-point types and understanding precision issues.
   - Best practices for performing calculations and avoiding common pitfalls.
   - Using functions and libraries for precise floating-point arithmetic when needed.

10. **Class with Canonical Form**
    - Implementing classes following the canonical form: default constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor.
    - Understanding the importance of defining and managing resource ownership correctly.
    - Examples demonstrating the Rule of Three (or Rule of Five) in modern C++.

11. **Standard Template Library (STL)**
    - Practical examples using the STL for efficient and convenient data manipulation.
    - Comprehensive coverage of algorithms, iterators, and STL containers.
    - Best practices for leveraging STL features in everyday programming.

## Getting Started

To run the projects, you will need a C++ compiler like GCC or an IDE like Visual Studio. Follow the instructions provided in each project folder to compile and execute the code examples.

Feel free to explore the code, make changes, and learn how these fundamental concepts come together to create robust C++ programs. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
